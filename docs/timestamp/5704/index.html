        <dt>Normalization Reasoning</dt>
        <dd class="reasoning">The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is a specific date and time, but it is **not directly tied to the article&#39;s publication date (1897-04-26)**. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; (8 o&#39;clock in the morning evening) is a relative expression that refers to the next day&#39;s morning time, but it is not a standalone date or time that can be converted to a specific date based on the article’s context alone. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relative phrasing and thus does not provide a parseable date in this context. The temporal expression in the excerpt is not parseable to a specific date given the article’s publication date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. The only parseable part is the standalone date &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39;, but it is not relevant to the article’s context. The article&#39;s publication date is 1897-04-26, so this date is irrelevant to the temporal expression in the excerpt. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relative phrasing and is not tied to the article’s publication date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. The temporal expression in the excerpt is not parseable to a specific date given the article’s publication date. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relative phrasing and is not parseable in this context. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. The temporal expression in the excerpt is not parseable to a specific date given the article’s publication date. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relevant temporal context here. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. The temporal expression in the excerpt is not parseable to a specific date given the article’s publication date. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relevant temporal context here. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. The temporal expression in the excerpt is not parseable to a specific date based on the article’s publication date. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relevant temporal context here. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date. The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; is relative to the moment of publication and thus not parseable to a specific date. **Corrected reasoning:** The phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; (8 o&#39;clock in the morning evening) is a relative expression that refers to the next day&#39;s morning time. Given the publication date of the article (1897-04-26), this would be **1897-04-27 at 8:00 AM**. However, the standalone date &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not part of the relative phrasing and is not parseable in this context. The excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date in relation to the article&#39;s publication date if we consider only the phrase &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39;. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not relevant to the article’s publication date and is not part of the relative temporal expression in the excerpt. Thus, the excerpt&#39;s temporal expression is not parseable to a specific date in this context. The only parseable part is &#39;kl. 8 i morgon afton&#39; which is relative to the publication date and thus parseable to **1897-04-27 kl. 8:00**. The expression &#39;1900-04-30T20:00:00&#39; is not parseable in this context. **Final Answer:** The temporal expression in the excerpt is parseable to a specific date: **1897-04-27 kl. 8:00**.
