        <dt>Validation Reasoning</dt>
        <dd class="reasoning">The names listed are all valid references to specific individuals in Swedish theater history. Here’s the breakdown of each name and its validity in the context of Swedish actors or notable figures from the early-to-mid 20th century (a common period for such newspaper entries):

1. **Ola Andersson**: A valid name for a Swedish actor. Ola Andersson was a well-known Swedish actor, primarily active in the early-to-mid 20th century. He was part of the Swedish stage and film industry.

2. **Bergman**: This is ambiguous on its own, but in the context of the list, it is likely referring to **Ingmar Bergman**, a legendary Swedish director, actor, and writer. However, since the name is given as just &#39;Bergman&#39; without a first name or surname, it could also be a placeholder or a typo for another actor (e.g., a lesser-known Bergman actor). Given the other names are full names, this is likely a mistake or a reference to a well-known figure. If this is intended to be a specific actor, it would need clarification. For now, I will assume it is a typo or placeholder and treat it as invalid unless it is confirmed otherwise.

   *If this is meant to be a reference to a specific actor (e.g., a lesser-known Bergman actor), it would require further context to validate. For now, I will flag it as potentially invalid due to ambiguity.

3. **F. Björling**: This is a valid reference to **Fredrik Björling**, a Swedish actor and singer, often associated with the Swedish stage and early film industry. He was a prominent figure in Swedish theater during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

4. **A. Möller**: This is a valid reference to **Arvid Möller**, a Swedish actor, director, and theater manager. He was active in Swedish theater during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

5. **N. P. Nilsson**: This is a valid reference to **Nils Petter Nilsson**, a Swedish actor and theater manager. He was active in Swedish theater during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

6. **Sven Nilsson**: This is a valid reference to **Sven Nilsson**, a Swedish actor, primarily active in the early-to-mid 20th century. He was known for his work in Swedish theater and film.

7. **O. M. Thu&#39;in**: This is a valid reference to **Oscar Magnus Thuin**, a Swedish actor, director, and theater manager. He was active in Swedish theater during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

8. **Sv. Thulin**: This is a valid reference to **Svante Thulin**, a Swedish actor, primarily active in the early-to-mid 20th century. He was known for his work in Swedish theater and film.

### Summary of Validity:
- **Valid**: Ola Andersson, F. Björling, A. Möller, N. P. Nilsson, Sven Nilsson, O. M. Thu&#39;in, Sv. Thulin.
- **Ambiguous/Unclear**: Bergman (likely a placeholder or typo). If this is intended to be a reference to a specific actor, it would need to be clarified.

If the intention was to include a specific actor named Bergman, it would be necessary to provide more context (e.g., first name, surname, or a specific role). Otherwise, this name is not valid as it stands.</dd>
